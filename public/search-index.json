To design Astro, we borrowed the best parts of our favorite tools and then added a few innovations of our own, including:\r\n\r\n- Bring Your Own Framework (BYOF): Build your site using React, Svelte, Vue, Preact, web components, or just plain ol' HTML + JavaScript.\r\n- 100% Static HTML, No JS: Astro renders your entire page to static HTML, removing all JavaScript from your final build by default.\r\n- On-Demand Components: Need some JS? Astro can automatically hydrate interactive components when they become visible on the page. If the user never sees it, they never load it.\r\n- Fully-Featured: Astro supports TypeScript, Scoped CSS, CSS Modules, Sass, Tailwind, Markdown, MDX, and any of your favorite npm packages.\r\n- SEO Enabled: Automatic sitemaps, RSS feeds, pagination and collections take the pain out of SEO and syndication.\r\n\r\n## H1 is good\r\n\r\n### H2 is good too\r\n\r\n> links are better\r\n\r\n[I know](they-are-better)\r\n\r\nThis post marks the first public beta release of Astro. Missing features and bugs are still to be expected at this early stage.
