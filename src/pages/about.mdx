            **Welcome!** I'm Brian and this is my own personal blog where I post articles on different aspects of technology such as DevOps, Cypersecurity, Linux, etc.

            **Astro-ink**  is a crisp, minimal, personal blog theme for Astro, that shows the capability of statically built sites - offering all the goodness and DX of the modern JS ecosystem without actually shipping any JS by default. 
            It's actually what this site is currently using! Please check it out here [Astro-Ink](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-ink/) to know more about it.
